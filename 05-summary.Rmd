# Summary

In this report, I have introduced the field of outlier detection using regression by looking at prominent and useful linear methods before extending these to their non-linear version. I have provided applications of these methods within R and looked at example applications to artifically created datasets. To assess these application, I have developed the *Z plot* which uses a simple heuristic to compare different outlier scores without preparation.
