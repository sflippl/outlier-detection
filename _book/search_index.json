["index.html", "Abstract", " Abstract This report will provide an overview over outlier detection in R. It starts by discussing some general principles of outlier detection. Linear methods and their nonlinear extensions are presented next. Along the general methods, examples of application and an appropriate methodology in R are introduced. The report will be concluded by a discussion of method evaluation as well as a comparison of the different introduced algorithms. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction: neurons, models and outliers", " Chapter 1 Introduction: neurons, models and outliers Statistics, like all science, are man-made. Acceptance of their presuppositions depends on human intuition of how to model connections between variables, what distributional assumptions make sense – and what constitutes an outlier. In many cases, these presuppositions are straightforward and we seldomly question them. This makes sense, of course. It is impossible to make progress if we questioned our most basic assumptions all the time. Before going on to outlier analysis, however, let us briefly revisit the beginnings of statistics. Francis Galton, an early pioneer of regression analysis, discovered a curious connection when analyzing body height of parents and their children. Figure 1.1: Galton’s heredity data in the psych package (Revelle 2018, dataset galton) Whereas taller parents had taller children, the offspring of particularly tall parents was smaller than them wheareas smaller parents’ children had a relatively large body height. In an attempt to characterize the connection he drew a line with a slope of 2/3. (Galton 1889, 96f.) Regression analysis has come a far way since then. His successors determined the more rigorous method of least squares to compute linear models. The slope determined by this method is 0.65; Galton’s visual estimation1 had therefore been quite accurate. Figure 1.2: Left: Galton’s original estimation (the line connecting C and D). Right: Least Squares linear model. Note that the x-axis now represents the parents’ height wheareas the childrens’ height is drawn on the y-axis. References "],
